# Summary
[summary]: #summary

One paragraph explanation of the feature.

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome?

# Pedagogy
[pedagogy]: #pedagogy

How should we explain and teach this feature to users? How should users understand this feature? This generally means:

- Introducing new named concepts.
- Explaining the feature largely in terms of examples.
- Explaining how users should _think_ about the feature, and how it should impact the way they use TracerBench. It should explain the impact as concretely as possible.
- If applicable, describe the differences between teaching this to existing Node programmers and new Node programmers.

It is not necessary to write the actual feature documentation in this section, but it should establish the concepts on which the documentation would be built.

# Details
[details]: #details

This is the technical portion of the RFC. Explain the design in sufficient detail that:

- Its interaction with other features is clear.
- It is reasonably clear how the feature would be implemented.
- Corner cases are dissected by example.

This section should return to the examples given in the previous section, and explain more fully how the detailed proposal makes those examples work.

# Critique
[critique]: #critique

This section discusses the tradeoffs considered in this proposal. This must include an honest accounting of the drawbacks of the proposal, as well as list out all the alternatives that were considered and rationale for why this proposal was chosen over the alternatives. This section should address questions such as:

- Why is this design the best in the space of possible designs?
- What other designs have been considered and what is the rationale for not choosing them?
- What is the impact of not doing this?

# Unresolved questions
[unresolved]: #unresolved-questions

- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the RFC process before this gets merged?
- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the implementation of this feature before stabilization?
- What related issues do you consider out of scope for this RFC that could be addressed in the future independently of the solution that comes out of this RFC?
